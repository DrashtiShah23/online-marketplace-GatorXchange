          Hello there! I am Drashti and am a senior at SFSU pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science.
          Currently, I work as a lab instructor for Introduction to Programming at SFSU. After I graduate I'd like to put
          my skills of mentoring and leading to work in the field of computer science.
          My favorite pass time acgtivities include painting a canvas, writing poems, and cooking food.
