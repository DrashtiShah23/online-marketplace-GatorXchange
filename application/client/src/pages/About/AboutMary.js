         Hello! My name is Mary Nicole Tangog. I'm a senior in San Francisco State University. I will be spending my last semester on Fall 2022 and will be graduating with a 
         with a Bachelors in Computer Science in Spring 2023. I would like to take this opportunity to improve and learn more about the front end, as well as understand the backend of a web.

         I enjoy listening to music, eating, and spending time with my dog, family, and friends. I also enjoy some thrill, where I was able to skydive 4 years ago at Monterey, CA. I would like to try bungee jumping.
         I want to be able to explore and travel to different countries. I also like to watch horror and thriller movies.
