            Hello! My name is Wilfredo Aceytuno Jolon. I was born in Guatemala but moved to the United States at the age of twelve.
            I am in my final year studying Computer Science. I completed an Associate Degree in Psychology from Skyline College. 
            I like reading, cooking and I am currently learning how to play piano.
