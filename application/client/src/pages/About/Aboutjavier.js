                    Hello, My name is Javier, and I grew up in San Francisco, CA. At SFSU, I am a Senior studying computer science and fianlly graduating this year.
                    After I graduate, I would love to travel around the world to experience all type of culture and food, because I know how to eat a lot of food haha,
                    then I would love to work as a backend and/or a full stack developer. On my free time, I love to powerlift at my local gym, weeb out on video games,
                    and experience music festival. I listen to various genre of music, but my favorite are RNB, electronic (trap, house, techno and dubstep), rap, and hip hop.
                    Thanks for stopping by and your time.
                </p>
