          Hi there. My name is Thomas. I am a senior at SFSU and will be graduating in Spring 2022 with a Bachelors in Computer Science.
          While I am wrapping up my last semester, I am working part time as web designer for SFSU's Bursar's Office and part time as 
          webmaster for the School of Engineering. I am looking to pursue a career in full stack development and this website you're on 
          right now serves as practice for me to improve my frontend and backend skills.
        </p>
        <br />

          My hobbies are video games, working out, listening to music, and going out with friends. I love drinking coffee, watching basketball, 
          and playing with my dog. My favorite types of movies and tv shows are thrillers, mysteries, action-adventure, and science 
          fiction. If you have similar interests, feel free to chat with me!
